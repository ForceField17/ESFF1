This is a README text describing the concept and the usage of perl
script "Trans_FF_IDPs".
Referring to DOI: 10.1111/cbdd.12314 & doi 10.1111/cbdd.12832
We had developed a specific force field ff99IDPs based on AMBER
ff99SBildn with dihedral energy map correction (CMAP) method to
simulate Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). And recently, 
we developed ff14IDPs based on AMBER ff14SB with the same method
to simulate IDPs. Both of the two force fields need to
transplant CHARMM energy function to AMBER's, which is just 
realized by "Trans_FF_IDPs".

=============
Simple Usages:
=============
1. Use Amber tLEaP or xLEaP to generate the normal PRMTOP file.
   Note: Please be sure to use ff99SBildn or ff14SB force field (
	source leaprc.ff99SBildn or source leaprc.ff14SB), 
	since the development is based on ff99SBildn and ff14SB respectly.
2. Copy all the files to the same directory with the PRMTOP file
	or anywhere else. I will take the same directory as example.
3. Add executable permission onto Trans_FF_IDPs if it hasn't:
	
	$ chmod +x Trans_FF_IDPs
	
4. Run the script with "-p" flag to specify the NORMAL PRMTOP file
	and "-o" flag to name the new PRMTOP file with CMAP parameters:

	$ ./Trans_FF_IDPs -p OLD_PRMTOP -o NEW_PRMTOP
	
	Then an interacting UI will guild you to finish the trans-
	planting.
5. Followings are the optional flags and their explanations:
	-c	Optional.
		Specify CMAP parameter file (CMAP_parameter_ff99IDPs or CMAP_parameter_ff14IDPs.)
		Please make sure the parameter file is at the same directory with
			Trans_FF_IDPs!

	-s	Silent Mode, optional.
		Run the script silently without any interacting UI.
		Note: In silent mode, all the proteins in the PRMTOP would
			be considered as IDP. And all the modified amino acids
			will be omitted.

	-h	Show the help information.
	-v	Show version information.
